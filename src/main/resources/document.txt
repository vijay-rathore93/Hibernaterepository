Generated types:
===================
1.Table: It creates a table hibernate_sequences with the sequence_name and value column, and value column will be equivalent to id in table.
2.Sequence: It creates a table hibernate_sequence with the sequence_name and value column, and value column will be contain next sequence for id in table.
Indicates that the persistence provider must assign  primary keys for the entity using a database sequence.
3.IDENTITY: it start id value with 1.
4.Auto:It will take best GenerationType according to DB type.(Sequence internally)


//States of object
//1.Transient:When object is not associated with session that time Object is in transient state.
//2.Persistance:When object is  associated with session that time Object is in Persistance state.All changes will be tracked in that.
//3.Detached:When object removed from hibernate session  that time Object is in transient state.

Load vs Get:
==============
Load :it will fetch the data from cache first if data is not there in cache then it will fetch data from DB,
if data again is not in DB then it will give ObjectNotFoundException exception.

Get :it will fetch data from DB, if data  is not in DB then it will give null object.

openSession vs getCurrentSession.
==================================
openSession():when we  are using opensession then we have to close session manually.
getCurrectSession():when we  are using getCurrectSession then no need to close session manually.
Hibernate will take care automatically.
